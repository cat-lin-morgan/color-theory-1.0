## Description <a name="description"></a>
This is a community-sharing and creativity application that was developed to provide designers, developers, illustrators, and others a place to browse, create, and share the colors that inspire them.  Users have the ability to visualize their ideas immediately by creating palette schemes that display to a sample webpage.  Users enjoy a community experience through the "liking" and saving of other users' palettes.  This application is an interactive MERN stack single-page application, focused on performance and efficiency, for meeting user demand.  The application was also designed with mobile-first at the forefront including the ability to access the application offline.  As a MERN stack, this application uses MongoDB for the database, Express.js for the server-side web framework, React.js for the client-side framework, and Node.js for the web server.  Apollo is used to create a GraphQL API.  Additionally, the application is a Progressive Web Application, including a web manifest for local installation and utilizes a service worker and IndexedDB for offline functionality.  The application also utilizes JSON Web Tokens for authentication.
